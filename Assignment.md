## PROG8051: Virtual Pet Simulator Project

Due – Thursday, 30th May at 11.59pm.
Detailed Assignment Description
Overview
Develop a console application in C# that simulates caring for a virtual pet. This comprehensive project encompasses fundamental programming concepts like basic program structure, console I/O, data types, type conversion, and control flow elements.

Here is how your final product roughly will look like

Detailed Project Features
 • Pet Creation:
 • Allow the user to choose a pet type (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit) and give it a name.
 • Display a welcome message that includes the pet's type and name.
 • Pet Care Actions:
 • Implement actions such as:
 • Feeding: Decreases hunger, slightly increases health.
 • Playing: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
 • Resting: Improves health, decreases happiness slightly.
 • Each action should modify the pet's stats accordingly and display a message describing the action's effect.

 • Pet Status Monitoring:
 • Track and display pet’s stats: hunger, happiness, and health, each on a scale of 1 to 10.
 • Implement a status check that warns the user if any stat is critically low or high.
 • Time-Based Changes:
 • Simulate the passage of time, where each action represents the passing of an hour.
 • Hunger increases over time, and happiness decreases slightly, prompting regular interaction.
 • Enhanced Interaction Logic:
 • Implement consequences for neglect, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
 • Include special messages or events based on the pet's status (e.g., the pet refusing to play if too hungry).
 • User Interface and Experience:
 • Develop a simple, clear, and user-friendly console interface.
 • Include instructions for the user on how to interact with the application.
Development and Submission Guidelines
 • GitHub Repository:
 • Create a GitHub repository for the project.
 • Regularly commit with descriptive messages.
 • Include a README.md with project description and setup instructions.
 • Final Submission:
 • Ensure all code is pushed to the GitHub repository before the deadline.
 • Submit the repository link through eConestoga.
 • Screencast video - Upload the video to a platform like YouTube and include the link in your README.md. Check the details of the recording below. You must follow the exact steps below.

Screencast Video Presentation
 • Record a brief video (no longer than 2 minutes)
Application Start (Duration: 30 seconds)
 • Launch Application:
 • Show the console window as the application starts.
 • Explain that you are choosing a pet type and naming it.

Main Interaction (Duration: 2 minutes)
 • Navigate Main Menu:
 • Walk through each option in the main menu briefly.
 • Explain what each option does.
 • Feed the Pet:
 • Choose to feed the pet.
 • Show how the pet's hunger decreases and health increases.
 • Pause to display the updated stats.
 • Play with the Pet:
 • Select the option to play with the pet.
 • Explain how this action increases happiness but also increases hunger.
 • Show the updated stats again.
 • Let the Pet Rest:
 • Demonstrate letting the pet rest.
 • Explain the effect on the pet's health and happiness.
 • Display the pet's status post-rest.
 • Check Pet Status:
 • Use the option to check the pet’s current status.
 • Point out the pet's health, hunger, and happiness levels.
 • Simulate Passing of Time (if implemented):
 • Describe how time affects the pet's stats.
 • Show the pet's status after simulating a 'time-pass' event.
Conclusion (Duration: 30 seconds)
 • Exit the Application:
 • Choose to exit the game.
 • Show the application closing.

Grading Criteria
 • Functionality (45%): The application runs smoothly, fulfilling all the outlined requirements.
 • Code Quality (30%): Well-organized, readable, and efficiently commented code.
 • GitHub Usage (15%): Consistent and clear usage of Git for version control.
 • Video Demonstration (10%): Effective demonstration of the game with a clear explanation of the features.
